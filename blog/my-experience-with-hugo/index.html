        <h1>My Experience With Hugo</h1>
        <p>In late 2018, I decided to rebuild my site. It was never really finished in the first place and it was written in old or obscure technologies, I didn&rsquo;t like it. Pug was great, but I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of being able to just write HTML and my build tooling was clunky to say the least.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d heard about Hugo while reading about different static site generators, I liked the fact that Hugo is written in Go, a language I love, and the features it promised looked reasonably good. What did I have to lose, I thought, If I hate it, I can just start again! There was no time contraint on this thing, so I could have fun with it.</p>

<p>When I started using Hugo, I was working through the getting started guide, it was quite well written, explanitory and helpful. I got up the the point where they started mentioning a theme, that&rsquo;s when I knew, I&rsquo;m definitely building my own theme. I already had a design planned out from my old site, all I had to do was build it.</p>
