      <description>In late 2018, I decided to rebuild my site. It was never really finished in the first place and it was written in old or obscure technologies, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. Pug was great, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of being able to just write HTML and my build tooling was clunky to say the least.
I&amp;rsquo;d heard about Hugo while reading about different static site generators, I liked the fact that Hugo is written in Go, a language I love, and the features it promised looked reasonably good.</description>

      <description>Why did my project, Arctor, fail as a concept, a learning experience, and as a project in general?
Back in 2018, I really wanted to learn Rust, it was getting big on the WASM scene and I felt like, as I Front Ender, I should jump on the new shiny and try it out. I decided that if I was going to learn Rust, I needed something small, something that I can iterate on without any hassle and it had to solve a problem I was having.</description>
