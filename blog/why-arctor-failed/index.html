        <h1>Why Arctor failed</h1>
        

<p>Why did my project, Arctor, fail as a concept, a learning experience, and as a project in general?</p>

<p>Back in 2018, I really wanted to learn Rust, it was getting big on the WASM scene and I felt like, as I Front Ender, I should jump on the new shiny and try it out. I decided that if I was going to learn Rust, I needed something small, something that I can iterate on without any hassle and it had to solve a problem I was having.</p>

<p>I did a lot of archive compression and extraction, and I really was bored of remembering tars extraction and compression commands, so I decided to solve it with code, this was my first mistake. To add context, I already have a command that does something similar, it&rsquo;s called extract, and it sits in my dotfiles, my problem was, I wanted to see if I could be faster, because everyone does all of those speed tests and shows Rust being super fast, things like <code>bat</code>, the <code>cat</code> replacer thats super fast and is prettier than it&rsquo;s predecessor.</p>

<p>Thinking about it now, my reasoning was wrong, it was skewed, I&rsquo;d bought too far into the whole &ldquo;look how fast Rust is!&rdquo; speil, I was in too deep.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s how it failed as a concept, I was building it for the wrong reasons, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-failed-as-a-learning-experience">How it failed as a learning experience</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done learning through trail and error before, and it&rsquo;s worked in the past, I don&rsquo;t work well with books, blog posts or anything like that, I have to get my hands dirty and feel the pain myself, it&rsquo;s just the way I learn, so builing a tool with no prior experience like this is nothing new to me, I did it with Angular, I did it with React, Lua, pretty much everything I use or have used.</p>

<p>The problem with Arctor was that the concept was just horrifically boring. I wanted to simplify but I went too far. The process would always be: Install a crate that can decompress the archive, look at some code online, copy the code, make sure it works, tweak and repeat for another archiving tech. This process over and over again draned me, I wasn&rsquo;t learing, I was copying code and then not questioning it once I did.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-failed-as-a-project">How it failed as a project</h2>

<p>Due to the project being physically draining, I could bring myself to finish it,
and unfinished software is already a failure. It was also too big of a fix for a very small problem, even saying it was a problem is an overstatement, it was a what if? What if I could do this faster?</p>

<h2 id="why-it-didn-t-fail-in-any-way-at-all">Why it didn&rsquo;t fail in any way at all</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t consider anything that happens or has happened to be a true failure, yes the project failed to teach me Rust, and I failed to finish the project, but it wasn&rsquo;t a failure because I learned about personal projects rather than learning Rust.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try and solve a problem that doesn&rsquo;t technically exist.

<ul>
<li>You are the target audeince to your personal projects, if you can&rsquo;t use it, who will?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Think through the features of your learing project

<ul>
<li>Doing repetitive things doesn&rsquo;t help you learn doesn&rsquo;t help you, it just bores you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Just because it&rsquo;s a small project, doesn&rsquo;t mean you have picked something plausible

<ul>
<li>small projects can be just as, or more draining than large projects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
